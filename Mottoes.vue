                  <p>Don't confuse schooling with education. I didn't go to Harvard but the people that work work for me did. Failure is an option here. If things are not failing, you are not innovating enough.

                  <p>Succes is most ofteh achieved by those who don't know that failure is inevitable. You age doesn't define your maturity, your grades don't define your intelligence, and rumors don't define who you are.
